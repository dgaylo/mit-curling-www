The 2020 College Curling National Championship that was originally rescheduled for October has been cancelled, so MIT will remain the reigning bronze medalists for another year. As announced <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Features/2020/August/18/College-Curling-Goes-Virtual-for-Fall-Semester?fbclid=IwAR2roQkpBbjVVc0Q9IjCQUXpPn17xvfXsMbUYbzREz0PltRf657DJA8tllo" target="_blank">here</a>, college curling will be virtual (at least for the fall). We will share more updates as more information on the virtual format becomes available, but in the mean time we will be looking for new MIT curlers to practice their ecurling skills to get ready for a virtual nationals competition!
