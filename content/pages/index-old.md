The MIT Curling Club is an ASA-recognized student group that... well... goes curling. All MIT students are welcome to join regardless of skill or experience. Interested students from other nearby schools that don't have a curling program should also feel free to contact us by emailing [the officers mailing list](mailto:curling-owner@mit.edu).

Our main activities include:

* Weekly curling practice during the season running from mid-October through the end of March. Practice is held on Fridays at [Broomstones Curling Club](http://www.broomstones.com) in Wayland and typically lasts from 3:00-7:30pm.
* Introductory events each semester to introduce those unfamiliar with the sport to the basics of curling.
* Competition in college bonspiels both regionally with other schools in the Northeast and nationally at the [US College Curling National Championships](http://www.collegecurlingusa.org).

# How to Join

To sign up for our mailing list and let us know your interest/experience level, fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh9PnNvJg60phe6eYWpnX5pDfun8lDJ3gHYN3Mw5zJQVXIBg/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

MIT Curling Club is always accepting new members from the MIT community, but you can also feel free to contact us if you're from a nearby school with no curling program of your own.

Our members range from amazing, experienced curlers to complete beginners. If you're a curler, then joining us is a great way to find a game. If you've never curled before, then our experienced curlers are ready and willing to teach you! If you're still hazy about what this curling thing is all about and simply want more information, check out [the FAQ](/faq). If you don't find a sufficient answer there, contact us [via email](mailto:curling-owner@mit.edu).
