# Welcome to MIT Curling!

### Save the date: Learn to Curl / First Practice Friday October 12 3:00pm

We practice off campus at Broomstones Curling Club in Wayland, MA. Transportation will be provided, and we'll have our experienced members, as well as coaches from our host facility, on hand to show you the ropes. We'll cover all the basics from stone throwing to sweeping, and give you the opportunity to play a short game. We leave MIT a little after 3, practice from 4-6, and return around 7. Best of all, it's 100% free to try.

Please RSVP using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8uECmHnOKr63JXJF1u2ai9ZPiI0m3c_rp2Dy7haWeFMc5A/viewform?usp=sf_link) to reserve a spot for the October 12 Learn to Curl session and let us know a little bit about you.

**Note:** Due to high interest, the September 28 Learn-to-Curl session is now full. We will give priority on October 12 to those who are unable to join us on the 28th.

If you aren't able to come to one of the Learn to Curl sessions, please feel free to [sign up for our mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh9PnNvJg60phe6eYWpnX5pDfun8lDJ3gHYN3Mw5zJQVXIBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and join us at [any Friday practice thereafter](/calendar)! While we won’t formally dedicate the entire practice to teaching first timers, we will still have dedicated curling instructors and senior team members available to take you off to the side and show you the ropes.

We are a [club sport](https://clubsports.mit.edu/) that... well... goes curling!

All MIT students, undergraduate or graduate, prior curling experience or not, are welcome to join. Our season runs from late September to early April, and our main activities include:

* Practices every Friday from 4-6pm at [Broomstones Curling Club](http://www.broomstones.com) in Wayland.
* Hosting Learn-To-Curl events during each season (generally once in October and once in February/March) to introduce curling to new recruits and to other members of the MIT community.
* Competing at [USA College Curling](http://collegecurlingusa.org/) tournaments around the northeast from Maine to New York to Connecticut in order to earn an invitation to the USA College Curling Nationals.
* Promoting this life long, surprisingly addictive sport around campus.

### Want to join?

Just fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh9PnNvJg60phe6eYWpnX5pDfun8lDJ3gHYN3Mw5zJQVXIBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll be in touch. No prior experience is necessary. Our members range from veteran curlers to complete beginners. If you're a curler, then joining us is an easy (and relatively cheap) way to find a game. If you've never curled before, then our coaches and experienced curlers are more than happy to teach you!

### Have more questions?

Take a look at our [FAQ](/faq), check us out on [Facebook]() or [Twitter](), or contact our officers directly via [email](mailto:curling-owner@mit.edu). We’re always happy to answer questions about our club specifically or the sport generally. Additionally, feel free to get in touch if you're from a nearby school with no curling program of your own.

See you on the ice!
