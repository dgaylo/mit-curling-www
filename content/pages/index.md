# Welcome to MIT Curling!

### 2011 National Champions

### 3rd Place: 2013, 2015, 2016

### Nationals Participants: 2014, 2017, 2018

We are a [club sport](https://clubsports.mit.edu/) that... well... goes curling!

All MIT students, undergraduate or graduate, prior curling experience or not, are welcome to join. Our season runs from late September to early April, and our main activities include:

* Practices every Friday from 4-6pm at [Broomstones Curling Club](http://www.broomstones.com) in Wayland.
* Hosting Learn-To-Curl events during each season (generally once in October and once in February/March) to introduce curling to new recruits and to other members of the MIT community.
* Competing at [USA College Curling](http://collegecurlingusa.org/) tournaments around the northeast from Maine to New York to Connecticut in order to earn an invitation to the USA College Curling Nationals.
* Promoting this life long, surprisingly addictive sport around campus.

### Want to join?

Just fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh9PnNvJg60phe6eYWpnX5pDfun8lDJ3gHYN3Mw5zJQVXIBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll be in touch. No prior experience is necessary. Our members range from veteran curlers to complete beginners. If you're a curler, then joining us is an easy (and relatively cheap) way to find a game. If you've never curled before, then our coaches and experienced curlers are more than happy to teach you!

### Have more questions?

Take a look at our [FAQ](/faq), check us out on [Facebook]() or [Twitter](), or contact our officers directly via [email](mailto:curling-owner@mit.edu). Weâ€™re always happy to answer questions about our club specifically or the sport generally. Additionally, feel free to get in touch if you're from a nearby school with no curling program of your own.

See you on the ice!
